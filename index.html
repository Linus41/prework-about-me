      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Thanks for visiting my first web page. I'm a curious problem-solver who wants to lead a meaningful life through code and art.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Michigan but spent most of my 
        adult life in the Pacific Northwest, where I attended 
        The Evergreen State College and got my first taste of coding
        in a program that put together weaving and computer programming.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to play music, drink coffee, draw, paint, and weave. I love color theory. I also make my own clothing!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to be a web developer and web designer and help artists create beautiful, dynamic, and highly functional websites. I'm also interested in app development.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Tucson, AZ. I love to travel and move around a lot, so who knows how long I'll be here?</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I love problem-solving and puzzles. 
        I also love visual design and aesthetics and want to take my creativity to another level. Learning web development seems like a great 
        way to launch a career. Prior to this I've been an artist who works in cafes, and I'm ready for a big change.
